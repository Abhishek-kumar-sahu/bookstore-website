        <h2>Book Overview :</h2>

        <p>*1984* by George Orwell, published in 1949, is a dystopian novel set in a totalitarian society under the rule of the Party, led by the figurehead Big Brother. The story follows Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the Party who works at the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to alter historical records to align with the Party's propaganda. The Party enforces complete control over its citizens, suppressing individuality, free speech, and independent thought.
        </p>
        <p>The society is characterized by constant surveillance, mind control, and the manipulation of truth, with slogans like "War is Peace," "Freedom is Slavery," and "Ignorance is Strength." The Thought Police monitor the populace to prevent rebellious thoughts, and anyone suspected of disloyalty is subjected to severe punishment or "re-education."
        </p><p>Winston secretly despises the Party and yearns for freedom. He begins a clandestine affair with Julia, a fellow Party member, and the two share their mutual disdain for the oppressive regime. Together, they explore their personal rebellion, but ultimately, they are betrayed, arrested, and tortured. Winston is forced to confront his greatest fear in the infamous Room 101, which ultimately breaks his spirit and forces him to submit to the Party’s authority, professing his love for Big Brother.
        </p>
        <p>*1984* explores themes of oppression, the dangers of totalitarianism, and the fragility of truth under authoritarian rule. It serves as a warning about the power of surveillance and the erasure of individual rights, leaving readers with a chilling portrayal of a society devoid of freedom and controlled through fear and deception.
