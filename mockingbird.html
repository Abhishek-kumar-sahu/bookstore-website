        <h2>Book Overview</h2>
        <p>*To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee, published in 1960, is a profound novel that explores themes of racial injustice, morality, and human empathy. Set in the 1930s in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, the story is told from the perspective of young Scout Finch, a curious and outspoken girl. Scout lives with her older brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus Finch, a wise and compassionate lawyer.

                Atticus is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Despite the clear evidence of Tom’s innocence, racial biases in the town create an almost insurmountable barrier to justice. Through Scout’s experiences, the reader witnesses the deeply ingrained prejudices of the community and the moral courage of individuals who stand against it. Atticus, embodying moral integrity, teaches Scout and Jem valuable lessons about empathy, courage, and standing up for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming odds.

            The novel also delves into Scout and Jem’s fascination with their reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley, who is rumored to be a dangerous figure. Over time, they come to realize that Boo is a misunderstood and kind-hearted person, culminating in him saving the children from an attack by Bob Ewell, Mayella’s vengeful father.
