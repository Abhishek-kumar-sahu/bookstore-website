                <h3>Overview :</h3>
                <font color="blue">*Ikigai: </font>Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life* by Héctor García and Francesc Miralles explores the Japanese philosophy of *ikigai*, which means "a reason for being." The book suggests that discovering one's ikigai can lead to a more meaningful, happy, and long life. It explores how ikigai lies at the intersection of four elements:

<h4>1. **What you love** (your passion),</h4>
<h4>2. **What you are good at** (your vocation),</h4>
<h4> 3. **What the world needs** (your mission),</h4>
<h4>4. **What you can be paid for** (your profession).</h4>

Through interviews with residents of Okinawa, Japan—known for its high percentage of centenarians—the authors identify lifestyle practices that contribute to health and longevity, like a balanced diet, regular physical activity, strong social ties, and a positive mindset. Key insights emphasize the importance of small, joyful routines, resilience, and staying active. 

*Ikigai* is a mix of self-help advice, Japanese philosophy, and lifestyle tips aimed at guiding readers toward a life filled with purpose, balance, and fulfillment.
