            <p>Jay Gatsby, originally James Gatz from a poor background, amasses a fortune to win back Daisy Buchanan, a woman he fell in love with before she married Tom Buchanan, an arrogant and wealthy man from East Egg. Daisy is enchanted by Gatsby’s lavish lifestyle, but societal expectations and personal insecurities ultimately keep them apart. Their affair culminates in tragedy, revealing the hollow nature of Gatsby's dreams and the moral decay of the society around him.
